## Abstract

<div class="text-justify">
This research introduces ByteWrist, a novel highly-flexible and anthropomorphic parallel wrist 
for robotic manipulation. ByteWrist addresses the critical limitations of existing serial and 
parallel wrists in narrow-space operations through a compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism 
integrated with arc-shaped end linkages. The design achieves precise RPY (Roll-Pitch-Yaw) 
motion while maintaining exceptional compactness, making it particularly suitable for complex 
unstructured environments such as home services, medical assistance, and precision assembly. The 
key innovations include: (1) a nested three-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize volume 
while enabling independent multi-DOF control, (2) arc-shaped end linkages that optimize force 
transmission and expand motion range, and (3) a central supporting ball functioning as a spherical 
joint that enhances structural stiffness without compromising flexibility. Meanwhile, we present 
comprehensive kinematic modeling including forward / inverse kinematics and a numerical Jacobian 
solution for precise control. Empirically, we observe ByteWrist demonstrates strong performance 
in narrow-space maneuverability and dual-arm cooperative manipulation tasks, outperforming 
Kinova-based systems. Results indicate significant improvements in compactness, efficiency, and 
stiffness compared to traditional designs, establishing ByteWrist as a promising solution for 
next-generation robotic manipulation in constrained environments.

## Design and Prototype of ByteWrist

<div class="text-justify">
ByteWrist is illustrated in Fig. 1a, which is driven by three stage motors. The output of the first-stage 
motor is connected to the first-stage driving linkage, which is further linked to the parallel platform via an 
arc-shaped end linkage. Meanwhile, the second-stage motor is mounted inside the first-stage driving linkage, 
its output connects to the second-stage driving linkage, which is also linked to the parallel platform through an 
arc-shaped end linkage. Similarly, the third-stage motor is fixed within the second-stage driving linkage, with 
its output attached to the third-stage driving linkage that connects to the parallel platform via an arc-shaped 
end linkage.

All three stage driving linkages and arc-shaped end linkages, as well as arc-shaped end linkages and parallel
platform, are connected via revolute pairs. All these six revolute pairs are oriented toward the center of the
parallel platform.

To enhance the stiffness of the parallel platform, a supporting ball is mounted at its center and connected
to the platform via a spherical joint. By controlling the movement of three stage motors, the end parallel
platform can achieve precise RPY motion.

<div class="text-justify">
The kinematics of the parallel wrist involves solving the relationship between θ1, θ2, θ3 and the RPY angles
of the parallel platform. For the forward kinematics part, the inputs are θ1, θ2, θ3, and the outputs are RPY
angles of the parallel platform.

Forward kinematics can be solved by the following system of equations.

Given that this system of equations is nonlinear, the Newton-Raphson method is adopted herein for iterative solution.

This research adopts the numerical method to solve the Jacobian matrix.

To verify the wrist range motion and high flexibility, this study designs a circular trajectory, enabling the
wrist to move in accordance with following equations.

As illustrated in Fig. 4(a-c), the input of wrist movement and the actual position feedback are plotted for 
cycles T = 4s, 2s and 1s respectively. Postures of ByteWrist at 8 distinct moments are presented in Fig. 
4(d-k), each corresponding to different pitch and yaw angles. Throughout the wrist movement, the yaw 
direction remains constant. Experimental results demonstrate that the robotic wrist exhibits flexible motion 
within this operational region.

### Hand-Arm Teleoperation System
<div class="text-justify">
The teleoperation interface comprises a Meta Quest 3 headset to track wrist poses and a Manus Quantum Metaglove for hand motions. The Quest controller is mounted to Manus glove's back via a custom holder to ensure synchronous tracking of wrist and finger movements. On the robotic side, the ByteDexter hand is mounted to a Franka Research 3 (FR3) arm, with its wrist–fingertip axis aligned to the arm's seventh joint. The operators' wrist poses captured by Quest headset are mapped directly to the FR3 end-effector, while hand motions from the Manus Glove are retargeted into joint position commands of the ByteDexter hand.

### Hand Motion Retargeting

<div class="text-justify">
  We retarget human hand pose data obtained from the Manus Glove into joint position references of the ByteDexter hand by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between corresponding keyvectors in the robotic and human hand. 
</div>

<TwoColumns>
  <div class="text-justify" slot="left">
      The right figure shows only the index-finger keyvectors for illustration. Iterating this process from the thumb to pinky and eliminating duplicates results in 15 unique keyvectors. Incorporating these keyvectors into optimization captures the majority of the grasping types: for pinch grasping, minimizing inter-finger distances aligns robotic and human hand poses to reduce operator strain; for power grasping, preserving fingertip-to-palm distances are prioritized.

## Results

### In-hand Manipulation Results

<div class="text-justify">
We evaluate three canonical in-hand manipulation primitives—(i) regrasping to translate objects between
fingers, (ii) sliding objects relative to the palm, and (iii) rotating objects or their components, and instantiate
them in four benchmark tasks: (1) regrasping a bottle from a precision to a power grasp; (2) multi-object
grasping; (3) lid unscrewing; and (4) push-to-open lids.

### Long-Horizon Teleoperation Results

<div class="text-justify">
  To assess long-horizon teleoperation capabilities, we evaluated the system using a table organization task. The scenario featured a cluttered workspace filled with randomly arranged cosmetic and skincare items alongside a multi-drawer organizer. This required the robotic hand-arm system to: (1) retrieve objects from the table; (2) place items into designated organizer compartments; and (3) successfully open the drawer and insert objects into it.
